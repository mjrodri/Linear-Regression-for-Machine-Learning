Project: Simple Linear Regression Model in Python

Description:

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model implemented using the scikit-learn library in Python. It aims to illustrate the basic principles of linear regression with a simulated dataset.

Features:

Generates a random dataset with three features and a target variable based on a linear function.
Trains a LinearRegression model on the generated data.
Predicts the target variable for a new set of input features.
Prints the prediction and the coefficients learned by the model.
Code Breakdown:

Imports:
LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model: imports the LinearRegression model class.
random: used to generate random numbers for the dataset.
Data Generation:
Creates two empty lists: feature_set and target_set.
Defines number_of_rows, random_number_limit (upper bound for random values).
Loops number_of_rows times:
Generates three random features (x, y, z) within the limit.
Calculates the target variable (function) based on a linear equation using the features.
Appends both feature and target values to their respective lists.
Model Training:
Creates a LinearRegression model object.
Trains the model using fit method with the generated feature and target sets.
Prediction:
Defines a test set with a single row containing specific features.
Uses predict method on the model to get the predicted target value for the test set.
Output:
Prints the predicted value and the model's learned coefficients.
Benefits:

Simple and easy-to-understand implementation of linear regression.
Illustrates the data generation, training, and prediction process.
Provides a starting point for further exploration of linear regression and machine learning concepts.
Limitations:

Uses a simulated dataset with a known linear relationship.
Doesn't involve real-world data or feature engineering.
Serves as a basic example and may not be applicable to complex scenarios.
Further Development:

Expand the dataset size and complexity.
Introduce noise or non-linear relationships.
Perform feature engineering and evaluate different models.
Visualize the data and model behavior.
I hope this ReadMe provides a clear overview of the project. Feel free to explore the code and build upon it for your own learning journey.
